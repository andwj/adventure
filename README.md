Adventure
=========

This is a very basic text adventure game, written in Rust.

It was inspired by the "steveklabnik/adventure" repository
on github, but I wanted to write something similar from scratch
to help learning the Rust language, and to make something a
little bit more substantial.

The license is CC0 license (i.e. public domain).

This code has no dependencies (crates), it just uses std::io
for input and output.
